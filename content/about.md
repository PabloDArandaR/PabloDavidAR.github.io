🤖 Hey there, I'm Pablo David Aranda Rodriguez, a Spanish 🇪🇸 Software Developer on a thrilling journey into the heart of robotics.

🔧 As a kid, I was the curious one who couldn't resist taking apart broken appliances to uncover their inner workings. The sight of a PCB with all its chips and soldering points sent shivers of excitement down my spine. Fast forward to today, and I've transformed my childhood fascination into a career.

📚 I studied a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering Technologies and completed my Master's in Industrial Engineering at the University of Zaragoza, my hometown. My journey didn't stop there, and after attending the last year of my first Master's at the University of Southern Denmark, I pursued a second Master's in Advanced Robotics Technologies at the latter institution. I even had the incredible opportunity to work as a robot programmer on a project for product assembly, a collaboration between the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk. ✈️ In the midst of my studies, I embarked on an adventure to Munich, Germany, to complete my Master's. During my time there, I joined Magazino as a Working Student Mechanical Engineer, gaining hands-on experience in the world of robotics.

🚗 While I was finishing my Master's Thesis, I found my calling at ARRK Engineering, where I now work as a Software Developer specializing in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving, more in particular in the CI side and the development of a variety of tools.

🕐 When I'm not immersed in the world of robotics, I lead a diverse life. I'm a sports enthusiast, hitting the gym, swimming, running, and even throwing in some boxing for good measure. I find solace in strumming my guitar, capturing moments through photography, and honing my culinary skills. Since moving to Munich, I've also discovered the joy of hiking in the picturesque landscapes on weekends. 📝 But my biggest passion is right here, on this blog. I'm dedicated to sharing my insights, discoveries, and experiences in the world of robotics.
